## hi enjoy this stupid write thing

To start using rayfield, you must load the Rayfield library with:
```lua
local Rayfield = loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://sirius.menu/rayfield'))()```
If you want to enable configuration saving + loading, put:
### Rayfield:LoadConfiguration()
at the bottom of your code.
